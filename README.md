Analyze Olympic events from the perspective of scheduling, medal distribution by sport, and venue usage.

### **Features**

| Component                                 | Description                                                                      | Status       |

### **Creative Contribution — Venue Usage Intensity Analysis**

The original Venue Map requirement could not be implemented since _venues.csv_ did not contain latitude/longitude data.

It has been replaced with a more meaningful analytical feature:

#### **Venue Usage Intensity (Bar Chart)**

A visualization of the **Total Duration (in days)** of events hosted at each venue.

**Advantages:**

- Provides actionable insights for future logistical planning.
- Highlights the most heavily used venues during the competition.

**Implementation:**

- Duration is calculated using each event's `start_date` and `end_date` from _schedule.csv_.
- Aggregated per venue and visualized in a bar chart.
